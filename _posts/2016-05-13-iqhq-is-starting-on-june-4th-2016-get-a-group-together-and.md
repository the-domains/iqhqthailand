English Headquarters is an English Language School which does 4 week long English courses. Each 4 week course is designed around a specific theme or topic and our objective is to intensively teach English around that theme for each of the 4 x 2hour classes.

Classes are done in groups with a minimum of 2 students and a maximum of 5 students in a class. We believe that groups are more effective than 1-1 classes as students can practice what they have learnt with one another and learn through doing instead of just writing worksheets.

The focus of all of our classes is on speaking, conversation and providing our students with the confidence to use English in real life situations.
